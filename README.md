> in-frame-STOP-finder.py

- This python script searches coding sequences for in-frame STOP codons (such as those found in pseudogenes and endogenous viral elements).
- The user defines whether they would like removal of the STOP (e.g., ready for selection tests), or soft-masking (conversion to lower-case)
- The script is currently designed to work with the (modified) output of the Genewise package, but it could be adapted to work on any coding sequence files, whether column or FASTA formatted.
